        <div>Marie Curie was the first woman who win a Nobel Prize twice and she was also the first woman to become a

            <p> She was born in Warsaw in 1867 (Kingdom of Poland then part of Russian Empire). She graduated at the age
                of 15. Marie was unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education in Warsaw because she was
                a woman. Marie made an egreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial
                assistance during Bronisława's medical studies
                in Paris in exchange for similar assistance two years later.</p>
            <p> In late 1891, she left Poland for Fance. She moved to her sister's place at first. After she rent a
                garret close to the university, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry and mathematics at
                the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891. She studied during the day and tutored
                evenings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>She awarded a degree in physics in 1893 and started to work in an industrial laboratory of Professor
                    Gabriel Lippmann.</li>
                <li>She earned her second degree in 1894 in mathematics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Marie had begun a scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various
                steels, commissioned by The Society for the Encouragement of National Industry.</p>
            <p>In 1894 she met Pierre Curie (1859-1906). Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly
                closer. On 26 July 1895 they got married in Sceaux. They shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips, and
                journeys abroad. They had two daughters; Iréne
                Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) and Éve Curie (1904-2007).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of
                    Paris.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Her achievement included the developement of the theory of radioactivity, techniques for isolating
                radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the
                world's first studies were conducted into the
                treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotops.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In <strong>1903</strong>, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri
                    Becquerel the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics</strong>,"in recognition of the extraordinary services they had rendered
                    by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena
                    discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel".</li>
                <li>In <strong>1911</strong> she awarded the <strong>Nobel Prize</strong> for second time. This award was "in recognition of her services
                    to the advancement of <strong>chemistry</strong> by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the
                    isolation of radium and the study of the nature and
                    compounds of this remarkable element".</li>
            </ol>
